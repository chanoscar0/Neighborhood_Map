# Neighborhood_Map
Neighborhood Map Application that demonstrates capabilities with APIs and MVC Frameworks.

In order to run the application, just open the index.html file in a web browser.

The purpose of this application is to showcase some landmarks within the Southern California Area, while using the Google Maps API, and Foursquare API to display some information.

All of the information in the pop-up window was drawn from the Foursquare API.

This application is meant to showcase my abilities in the design concepts for front-end frameworks like Knockout.js while working with the Google Maps API.

In the future, I would like to modify this file to utilize frameworks like React or Angular JS.
