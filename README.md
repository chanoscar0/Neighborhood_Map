# Neighborhood_Map
Neighborhood Map Application that demonstrates capabilities with APIs and MVC Frameworks

The purpose of this application is to showcase some landmarks within the Southern California Area, while using the Google Maps API, and Foursquare API to display some information.

This application is meant to showcase my abilities in the design concepts for front-end frameworks like Knockout.js

Utilizing the Model View ViewModel framework helps organize the changing variables of the front-end of the web application.
